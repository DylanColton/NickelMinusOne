# NickelMinusOne

The purpose of this project is to build a robust and scalable imageboard website.

This project incorporates php, HTML, CSS, JS and SQL.

## HTML
This is provided in the simplist form, just as structure to the documents.

## CSS
This is broken up into "structure" and "style".
The "structure.css" file is our structure and is constant throughout the website.
The "style" is dependant on the choice of each user, able to select whichever styling they enjoy the most.

## JS
This shall be used lightly for improving responsive designs and for conditioning any posts to the server.

## SQL
This is the databasing query language, used to 'CRUD' the data used in the website.

## php
This is the bulk of the website, managing page layout, utilizing structures to populate a page.
php is the primary interfacer with the database;
The point to attempt a prevention of JS injection, as a lack of ability to alter the php means clients have far less control over the database, as the server handles it.

To be frank, this is more of a hobby project. It is a fun endeavour to develop a website using Web2.0 architecture.
Additionally, finding limitations and overcoming is the best way for a programmer to develop their skills,
simply memorising library methods and properties fails to be enough, there must be demonstration of competence.

As my programming hero, Terry A. Davis would say: "An idiot admires complexity, but the genius admires simplicity".
We live in a world of complex admirers, rather than simple admirers.
This is meant as a condemnation from me, as needless complexity will invariably lead to misfortune,
especially in the automation and engineering industry.
I say this as with codebases far too complex will lead to oversights becoming far too common,
and with common oversights, will lead to injury and death.

That is a small snippit of my thesis on code writing.

## Simplicity is paramount.
## Variables should have precise names, short and efficient.
## A consistent casing should be established and followed from a project's outset
## Variables should have a low number of write-to locations
## If a variable should have a larger number of write-tos, they should be close together in the code, even a separate document to contain its write-to behaviour.
